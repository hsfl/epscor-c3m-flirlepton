1) open up the terminal and type:
cd libuvc

2) to run the data collection, type
python readout.py 

2a) if you get an error that says uvc_open_error, type and run: 
sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/bus/usb/ 

if it asks for a password, the password is on the post it. 

try running line 4 again

to kill the data collection, click the terminal and press Ctrl+C. 

3) To view the data you just got type: 
python binary_viewer.py

4) The program will be set to overwrite whatever is in the file so make sure that you are either okay with that or set a new directory in the code. 

5) To edit the python programs in vscode (e.g. change directory, type:
code <name_of_file> 

and change the output directories to avoid overwriting.
